Aetheric Web: JAWR Manifest
===========================

This little utility adds a servlet that generates an HTML5 cache manifest based on what resources are available to JAWR
when it is requested. In addition, it uses etag and comment hashes to make sure that if any of the resources change,
that change causes the manifest content to be re-downloaded as per the manifest spec.
